= Irresponsible Ruby

What is #irresponsibleruby?

= Irresponsible Ruby

Ruby code that you wouldn't deploy at your day job because it's just too interesting or creative.

= Irresponsible Ruby

* Neat hacks
* Weird metaprogramming
* Unusual techniques
* No Unit Tests

= Creativity

  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_height = 100


= Creativity

"A letter from _why"

= Creativity

I do not write tests for my code.  I do not write very many comments.  I change styles very frequently. 

= Creativity

And, most of all, I shun the predominant styles of coding because that would go against the very essence of experimentation.

= Creativity

In short: all I do is muck around.

= Creativity

I admire programmers who take risks.  They aren’t afraid to write dangerous or “crappy” code.

= Creativity

If you worry too much about being clean and tidy, you can’t push the boundaries. 

= Creativity

Until an asteroid,

_why

= Creativity

  # image
  # src = write_tests.png
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_height = 25

= Creativity

In the end, _why was right.


But so was I.

= Two Modes

Programmers produce things. We're builders.

= Two Modes

"Linguistic Relativity"

= Two Modes

* Responsible Mode
* Irresponsible Mode

= Two Modes

* TDD Mode
* "Exploratory Mode"

= Two Modes

We need both!

= FRP Introduction

FRP has two parts:

* Functional
* Reactive

= FRP Introduction

Functional programming: functions as a first-class concept.

= FRP Introduction

Reactive Programming: data flows as a first-class concept.

= FRP Introduction

FRP: using first-class functions to manipulate data flows

= FRP Introduction

Data flows?

= FRP Introduction

  # coderay ruby

  a = 5
  b = a + 6
  b # => 11
  a = 6
  b # => 11

= FRP Introduction

  # coderay ruby

  a := 5
  b := a + 6
  b # => 11
  a := 6
  b # => 12

= FRP Introduction

* "time varying value": "behavior" or "signal"
* "events": occurs many times over time
* "switching": react to events

* Circle Example

= Frappuccino

The most irresponsible code I've written lately.

= Go Forth And Be Irresponsible

  * Be Creative.
  * Do 'bad' things.
  * Let's have fun with Ruby!
