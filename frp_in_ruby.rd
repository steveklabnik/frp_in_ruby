= Irresponsible Ruby

What is #irresponsibleruby?

= Irresponsible Ruby

Ruby code that you wouldn't deploy at your day job because it's just too interesting or creative.

= Irresponsible Ruby

* Neat hacks
* Weird metaprogramming
* Unusual techniques
* No Unit Tests

= Creativity

"A letter from _why"

= Creativity

I do not write tests for my code.  I do not write very many comments.  I change styles very frequently. 

= Creativity

And, most of all, I shun the predominant styles of coding because that would go against the very essence of experimentation.

= Creativity

In short: all I do is muck around.

= Creativity

I admire programmers who take risks.  They aren’t afraid to write dangerous or “crappy” code.

= Creativity

If you worry too much about being clean and tidy, you can’t push the boundaries. 

= Creativity

Until an asteroid,

_why

= Creativity

  # image
  # src = write_tests.png
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_height = 25

= Creativity

In the end, _why was right.


But so was I.

= Two Modes

Programmers produce things. We're builders.

= Two Modes

"Linguistic Relativity"

= Two Modes

* Responsible Mode
* Irresponsible Mode

= Two Modes

* TDD Mode
* "Exploratory Mode"

= Two Modes

We need both!

= Go Forth And Be Irresponsible

  * Be Creative.
  * Do 'bad' things.
  * Let's have fun with Ruby!
